# Is Southern Afrotemperate Forest Expanding in the Cape Peninsula?
<br>
Investigating whether pioneer forest species indicate forest expansion, using GIS and species occurrence data to assess forest dynamics.
<br>
Species that are Southern Afrotemperate Forest pioneers: *Virgilia oroboides* (Cape Keurboom), *Virgilia divaricata* (Garden Route Keurboom), *Rapanea melanophloeos* (Cape Beech), and *Kiggelaria africana* (Wild Peach).
<br>
Observation data from iNaturalist and City of Cape Town vegetation layers will be used.

```

All of the tree species, except *Rapanea melanophloeos*, had more observations more than 250m from Southern Afrotemperate Forest than within this vegetation type. However, the extent of Southern Afrotemperate Forest is small on the Cape Peninsula.  <br>  
The majority of species seem to be expanding into Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos more than other vegetation types. However, *Kiggelaria africana* seems to be expanding more into Peninsula Granite Fynbos.


```{r combo}
# Combine all species data into a single dataframe
combined_data <- bind_rows(species_data, .id = "Species")

# Define a color palette for vegetation type
veg_colors <- viridis::viridis(length(unique(combined_data$National_)))

# Define unique shapes for each species
species_shapes <- c("Virgilia oroboides" = 15,  
                    "Virgilia divaricata" = 16, 
                    "Rapanea melanophloeos" = 17, 
                    "Kiggelaria africana" = 18)

It's hard to see what's going on here so let's try a interactive map.

```{r interactive}
# Ensure data is in WGS84 (longitude-latitude)
combined_data <- combined_data %>% st_transform(4326)
vegr <- st_transform(vegr, 4326)

# Define a color palette for speceis
species_palette <- colorFactor(brewer.pal(min(9, length(unique(combined_data$Species))), "PuOr"), combined_data$Species)

# Define a color palette for vegetation type
veg_palette <- colorFactor(viridis(length(unique(vegr$National_))), vegr$National_)


# Create iNaturalist links for popups
combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(iNat_link = paste0("<a href='https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/", id, 
                            "' target='_blank'>View on iNaturalist</a>"))

# Leaflet Map
leaflet(combined_data) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = vegr,
    fillColor = ~veg_palette(National_),  # Use colorFactor function
    color = ~veg_palette(National_), 
    weight = 1,
    fillOpacity = 0.5,
    popup = ~paste("<b>Vegetation Type:</b>", National_)
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = combined_data,
    lng = ~st_coordinates(geometry)[,1], 
    lat = ~st_coordinates(geometry)[,2], 
    radius = 5, 
    color = ~species_palette(Species),  # Use colorFactor function
    fillOpacity = 0.9,
    popup = ~paste("<b>Species:</b>", Species, "<br>",
                   "<b>Vegetation Type:</b>", National_, "<br>",
                   iNat_link)
  ) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", 
            pal = species_palette, 
            values = combined_data$Species, 
            title = "Species") %>%
  addLegend("topright", 
            pal = veg_palette, 
            values = vegr$National_, 
            title = "Vegetation Type")

```
From these maps, it appears that Southern Afrotemperate Forest may be expanding in the northern half of the Cape Peninsula. Historical pine plantations that are now nature reserves in this region may be hotspots for forest expansion, likely because fire was excluded for long periods while the plantations were in operation. Additionally, Silvermine Dam may be facilitating Southern Afrotemperate Forest expansion.
<br>
However, some of the observations are in parks, botanical gardens, and plantations. This likely accounts for the majority of points in Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. Additionally, it is likely natural for Southern Afrotemperate Forest to exist around small streams and rivers, but the vegetation map scale is too coarse to capture these accurately.
